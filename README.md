# Planner

A project planning tool.

## Next steps for v1
*  Use colspan to display label text more effectively
*  Sort out formatting on multi-line notes
*  Order the developer rows to match plan
*  Display leaf nodes
*  Re-integrate gantting-out logic
*  Display "plan", "gain"

## Later display options
*  Personal daily spreadsheet
*  Display "from-now", omitting completed tasks
*  Display individual PRDs
*  Display budgets only

## Minor tidy-ups
*  Text alignment of week labels above labels should be centered, not left-justified.
