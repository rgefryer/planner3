# Planner

A project planning tool.

## Next steps for v1
*  Use table-rendering library to allow scrolling.  Datatables.net?
*  Re-add management resource
*  Phasing resource prediction - mgmt, smear, frontfill, backfill.  Serial phasing all at front-fill time.
 *  Idea - descend the nodes flagging which to update, then process.
*  Re-implement serial resourcing


## Later display options
*  Personal daily spreadsheet
*  Display "from-now", omitting completed tasks
*  Display individual PRDs
*  Display budgets only
*  Freeze header, 

## Minor tidy-ups
*  Sort out formatting on multi-line notes
*  Order the developer rows to match plan
*  Text alignment of week labels above labels should be centered, not left-justified.
